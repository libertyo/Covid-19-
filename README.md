# Covid-19 Cases and Mortality in the United States-

A novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was the cause of a global pandemic at the beginning of 2020. The United States was the country with the most reported cases of COVID-19. There are two datasets (covid_us_county.csv and us_county.csv) that were provided by the Johns Hopkins University and can be downloaded on Kaggle. The datasets contain information about total COVID-19 cases and deaths by county and gender. A JSON file containing U.S. states was downloaded from Kaggle as well. 

A Tableau dashboard was created using the data analysis from the attached Python scripts. Not all analysis was included. Link to dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19_Project_16941532615830/Covid-19Project?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
